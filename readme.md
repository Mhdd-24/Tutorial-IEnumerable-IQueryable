# IEnumerable vs IQueryable in C#

This tutorial explains the core differences between `IEnumerable` and `IQueryable` in C#. These two interfaces are crucial for querying and manipulating collections, both in-memory and from external data sources like databases.

---

## 📘 Overview

| Interface    | Description                                      |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `IEnumerable`| Used for in-memory data iteration and querying.  |
| `IQueryable` | Used for querying remote data sources like databases with LINQ-to-SQL translation. |

---

## 🔹 IEnumerable

### ✅ Definition:
`IEnumerable<T>` is an interface in the `System.Collections.Generic` namespace used to iterate through collections.

### 📌 Key Features:
- In-memory data processing.
- Suitable for collections like arrays, lists, etc.
- LINQ queries run **after** data is fetched.
- Supports deferred execution.

### 🧠 Example:
```csharp
List<int> numbers = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
IEnumerable<int> evenNumbers = numbers.Where(x => x % 2 == 0);

foreach (var number in evenNumbers)
{
    Console.WriteLine(number);
}
```

---

## 🔹 IQueryable

### ✅ Definition:
`IQueryable<T>` is an interface in the `System.Linq` namespace that allows LINQ queries to be executed against a database or other external source.

### 📌 Key Features:
- Queries remote data sources (like Entity Framework).
- Translates LINQ queries to SQL.
- Executes on the server-side.
- Supports efficient querying for large datasets.

### 🧠 Example:
```csharp
using (var context = new MyDbContext())
{
    IQueryable<Employee> employees = context.Employees.Where(e => e.Salary > 50000);

    foreach (var emp in employees)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(emp.Name);
    }
}
```

## 🔄 Key Differences

| Feature           | IEnumerable            | IQueryable             |
|------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| Execution         | Client-side (in memory)| Server-side (database)  |
| Performance       | Less optimized         | More optimized for large data |
| Namespace         | System.Collections     | System.Linq             |
| Use Case          | In-memory collections  | Remote data queries     |

---

## 🧩 When to Use What?

- Use **`IEnumerable`** when working with in-memory collections or when you want simple iteration.
- Use **`IQueryable`** when querying a database or remote source and want the query to be executed on the server.

---

## ✅ Conclusion

Understanding the difference between `IEnumerable` and `IQueryable` is essential for writing efficient and optimized C# code—especially when dealing with large datasets or databases.
